It also calculates total revenue per month, per product, and per customer, and identifies the top 10 customers by revenue
Uses Docker Compose file format version 3.9.</br>

**Docker Compose:** Manages multi-container Docker applications.
Defines a service taxn with its build context and environment configuration in docker-compose-Taxn.yml.
Defines a service test_pytest with its build context in docker-compose-test_pytest.yml.</br>

**Dockerfile for Tests:** Prepares an isolated environment to run Python unit tests using unittest and pandas.
Base Image: Python 3.11-slim.
Working Directory: /usr/src/app.
Install Dependencies: Installs pandas.
Dockerfile for Main Application: Prepares an isolated environment to run the main application script (Taxn.py), ensuring all dependencies are installed and required files are copied into the container</br>
